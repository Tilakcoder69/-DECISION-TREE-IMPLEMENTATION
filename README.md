DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

##
During the four-week internship at CodTech IT Solutions, Bodana Tilak worked on a practical and insightful project in the field of Machine Learning, with a primary focus on developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Decision Tree Classifier using Python. The objective of the project was to simplify the process of training, evaluating, and visualizing decision trees, thereby making Machine Learning models more accessible to users without requiring deep programming knowledge.

The project involved the design and implementation of a complete application using the `tkinter` library, which is Python’s standard GUI toolkit. The application allows users to load CSV datasets, select target columns for classification, specify test sizes for splitting the data, train a Decision Tree model, and visualize the resulting tree using matplotlib. A significant feature of the project is its ability to dynamically adapt to different datasets, making it versatile for various classification problems.

Bodana demonstrated proficiency in integrating core machine learning tools such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`. The backend of the application uses a `DecisionTreeClassifier` from the `scikit-learn` library to train models. Users can view accuracy scores and classification reports generated after training, helping them evaluate model performance effectively.

Moreover, Bodana implemented features to enhance user interactivity. For instance, the system supports the prediction of new data records via a dynamically generated input form. The user inputs values for all features used in training, and the system outputs a predicted class. Additionally, the application allows exporting the trained decision tree as an image file, which can be useful for presentations or documentation purposes.

One of the notable aspects of this project was the emphasis on user-friendly design. The interface is intuitive and neatly structured, ensuring users can operate the application with minimal guidance. The intern also paid attention to error handling—for instance, alerting users if invalid files are loaded or if model training encounters any issues.

This internship project offered Bodana Tilak a solid understanding of not only machine learning principles but also the importance of creating practical tools that bridge the gap between technical complexity and user accessibility. By the end of the internship, Bodana had successfully delivered a fully functional application that encapsulated the machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction—all through a GUI.

In summary, the project served as an excellent demonstration of integrating machine learning algorithms with interactive interfaces. Bodana Tilak showed commendable initiative, coding proficiency, and a problem-solving mindset throughout the internship period, completing the project with great attention to functionality and usability. This work stands as a testament to Bodana’s capability to develop data-driven applications that are both robust and user-centric.
